# rare-latency-events
This repository contains the python source code (jupyter notebook) used to visualize and analyze the latency data of a single network flow. It makes use of a statistical method called Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The preprocessed data as well as the resulting figures are included as well. We make use of the functionality offered by Knight et al. in [this git repository](https://github.com/iagolemos1/thresholdmodeling)

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results on your on machine, you will need to install Anaconda (Python 3) and the required R and rpy2 packages. More detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/iagolemos1/thresholdmodeling/blob/master/README.md).
